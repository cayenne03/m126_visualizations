The live website of this project is hosted in GitHub pages, under my account, in this link: https://cayenne03.github.io/m126_visualizations/me.html

In this 1st homework we did the following:


1) For the 1st page:

- The divs are click-able, so once clicked some text appears.


2) For the 2nd page:

- Clicking on the basketball court changes the color, random colors are picked.
- Clicking on the ball it stops its motion, and if clicked again it starts moving on the y-axis again.
- Clicking on the player's card flips the card showing the player's team image.
- Changing the dropdown selection changes the top-5 data.


3) For the 3rd page:

- The shapes start moving from left to right, once clicked they stop, if clicked again the direction of the motion is reversed, if clicked again it stops again.
- Once each shape disappears from the screen it re-appears from the other side.
